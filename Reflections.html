									<p><h3>Unit 1</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 1 I was introduced to the history of Information Security Management. As well as the modern classifications that are used to model threats and discover vulnerabilities. I also meet up with my group members for the first time. Everyone seems very knowledgeable and ready to succeed. We decided I am going to write the first part of the essay. I think it will be a really interesting paper to research and write.
									</p>
							
						
									<p><h3>Unit 2</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 2 I was introduced to real-world security issue's, along with implications of information security threats and vulnerabilities. An article was read that described a real-world example of security threats and vulnerabilities. The article provided great insight into how people conduct tests but also ways that threats can be defended against. As well I continued to learn more about threat modelling with Stride and Dread. I also started working on the introduction portion of our group project. So far the material has been challenging but I feel that I have learned a lot about cyber laws and regulations just from research alone.  
									</p>
						
									<p><h3>Unit 3</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 3 I was introduced to the Network Fundamentals. Networking as a subject is something I am familiar with as I work as a network technician. It did, however, provide a great refresher on the subject and some more insight into the history of the field. I also meet up with my group again to go through this weeks work. We all talked through what I wrote for the introduction and it was generally well received. I did make a mistake in the citations, but it was good that it was pointed out. I learned something new from it. 
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 4</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 4 I was introduced to common networking command-line tools. The majority of these tools I am very familiar with and use on a regular basis. Especially tools like ping or traceroute I use often as a network technician to check if field equipment is up. However, the books assigned did provide further information about how the tools are used for cyber security. Doing the weekly assignment also gave me some good practice as well. 
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 5</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 5 I was introduced to networking tools and components. The majority of the information discussed I was already familiar with and had a good working knowledge of. I did gain more information about the cloud and other virtual networking tools. Cloud-based networking is something I don't have a lot of experience with. This unit in particular provided me with a good foundation of information, that I was then able to take and research more information from. I also worked again on the group project. I had previously finished up my contribution. However, since it was almost finished I again went through it and cleaned up some minor mistakes throughout. Though overall, it is a well-written paper and my group members did a great job. 
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 6</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 6 I was introduced to network and vulnerability scanning tools. This unit was very interesting and provided a lot of new information. I had little previous information about these tools and their capabilities. It emphasised the sheer scope of tools available to use. A significant amount of further practice would be necessary to truly remember how to use the tools but also make effective use of them. Looking ahead at the final project, I feel that I am going to get a lot more practice with them later. I also turned in our group project. I feel that we did a good job and worked well together. Working in groups admittedly has its ups and downs, and we had some minor issues. Overall, I am glad we overcame them and submitted a good quality project. 
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 7</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 7 I was introduced to risks and the common standards used to classify them in the Information Security Management field. These standards are incredibly important in the information technology field. They are used every day by companies to make major decisions. At the same time, they are very complex and difficult to understand without practice implementing them. I need to do significantly more studying on the standards to get a better understanding of them. Since some of these do apply to me as an IT professional. I also started working on the final project. It was decided that I again will write the introduction. It was a challenge working through all the different vulnerability scanning tools but I feel that I have learned a ton from it. 

									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 8</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 8 I was introduced and further educated on several topics, including the GDPR and financial standards. In particular, I learned a lot by working through the discussion post and the seminar preparation assignment. I also meet up with my group and we went over my portion. Overall, everyone seems to think I did a good job. I feel that my portion is good but can always be improved upon. 									
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 9</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 9 I was introduced to some very interesting topics in cyber logging and forensics. Cyber forensics was very interesting to study and read about. This unit really showed me something interesting, that I could possibly pursue as a career. Though I feel that it is a very high-level subject and career-wise it is something that you need a lot of experience in before you can really commit to it. Despite that, I am sure I can succeed and at the very least the tools from it can be used in lower-level cyber security positions as well. 									
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 10</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 10 I learned about mitigating security breaches. This unit was very interesting and enlightening. In particular, this unit gave me a great set of skills that I should build off. As someone who wishes to be a security analyst, analysing security breaches is something I must know. Though I feel that I have a long way to go as it was confusing in certain areas. I am sure I will get more practice down the line as I progress through the different modules. 
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 11</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 11 I learned more about the future of security systems. It showed me more about just how much there is to learn in the cyber security field. There is an infinte amount of possible security threats. For me it showed that to be sucessful in the cyber security field, one has to constantly be aware of changing trends.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 12</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 12 I learned more about the future of the internet. It further reinforced the concepts about how vast the internet and technologies are. At the same time, it is really exciting about the future. As well I don't think a career in cyber security can get boring, with how many changes are possible. Overall, I think this module has been great. I learned a lot of new skills and got to meet some interesting people. I look forward to the next course and all of the new skills I can again learn.
