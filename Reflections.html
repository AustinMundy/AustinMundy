									<p><h3>Unit 1</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 1 I was introduced to the history of Information Security Management. As well the modern classifications that are used to model threats and discover vulnerabilites. 
									</p>
							
						
									<p><h3>Unit 2</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 2 I was introducted to real world security issue's, along with implications of information security threats and vulnerabilities. A article was read that described a real world example of security threats and vulnerabilites. The article provided great insight into how people conduct tests but also ways that threats can be defended against. As well I continued to learn more about threat modeling with Stride and Dread.  
									</p>
						
									<p><h3>Unit 3</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 3 I was introducted to the Network Fundamentals. Networking as a subject is something I am familar with as I work as a network technician. It did however, provide a great refresher on the subject and some more insight into the history of field.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 4</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 4 I was introducted to common networking command line tools. The majority of these tools I am very familiar with and use on a regulary basis. However, the books asigned did provide further information about how the tools are used for cyber security. 
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 5</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 5 I was introducted to networking tools and components. The majority of the information discussed I was already famimlar with and had a good working knowledge of. I did gain more inforamtion about the cloud and other virtual networking tools. Cloud based networking is something I don't have a lot of experince with. This unit in particular provided me with a good foundation of information, that I was then able to take and research more information from.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 6</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 6 I was introducted to network and vulnerability scanning tools. This unit was very interesting and provide a lot of new information. I had little previous information about these tools and their capabilities. It really emphasised the sheer scope of tools available to use. A significant amount of further practice would be necessary to truley rememeber how to use the toosl but also make effective use of them. 
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 7</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 7 I was introducted to risks and the common standards used to classify them in the Information Security Management field. These standards are incredibly important in the information technology field. They are used everyday by companies to make major decisions. At the same time they are very complex and difficult to understand without pracitce implementing them. I need do significantly more studying on the standards to get a better understanding of them
