									<p><h3>Unit 1</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 1 I was introduced to the history of Information Security Management. As well the modern classifications that are used to model threats and discover vulnerabilites. 
									</p>
									<li><a href="Unit 1 Team Project.docx">Unit 1 Team Project</a></li>
									<p><h3>Unit 2</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 2 I was introducted to real world security issue's, along with implications of information security threats and vulnerabilities. A article was read that described a real world example of security threats and vulnerabilites. The article provided great insight into how people conduct tests but also ways that threats can be defended against. As well I continued to learn more about threat modeling with Stride and Dread.

									<p><h3>Unit 4</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 4 I was introducted to common networking command line tools. The majority of these tools I am very familiar with and use on a regulary basis. However, the books asigned did provide further information about how the tools are used for cyber security. 
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 5</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 5 I was introducted to networking tools and components. The majority of the information discussed I was already famimlar with and had a good working knowledge of. I did gain more inforamtion about the cloud and other virtual networking tools. Cloud based networking is something I don't have a lot of experince with. This unit in particular provided me with a good foundation of information, that I was then able to take and research more information from.

									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 9</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 9 I was introducted to some very interesting topics in cyber logging and forensics. Cyber forensics was very interesting to study and read about. This unit really showed me somthing interesting, that I could possibly pursue as a career.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 10</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 10 I learned about mitigation security breaches. This unit was very interesting and enlightening. In particular this unit gave me a great set of skills that I should built of. As someone who wishes to be a secuirty analyst, analysing security breaches is definitely something I must know.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 11</h3></p>
									<p>
									<li><a href="Unit 11 Executive Summary Personal Contribution.docx">Unit 11 Executive Summary Personal Contribution</a></li>
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 12</h3></p>
									<p>
									In unit 12 I learned more about the future of the internet. It further reinforced the concepts about how vast the internet and technologies are. At the same time it is really exciting about the future. As well I don't think it is possible for a career in cyber security to get boring, with how many changes are possible.
